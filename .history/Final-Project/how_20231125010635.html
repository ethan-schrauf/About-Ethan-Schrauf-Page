      <p>Several experts emphasize that Universal Design should be approached as a design philosophy rather than a rigid checklist or a set of predefined solutions, measurements, or products. On this page, we aim to establish a step-by-step method for achieving Universal Design on the web. To initiate this process, we will explore fundamental design principles outlined by cognitive scientists and design authorities. One key influence in this domain is Donald Norman, whose significant impact on design practices is evident in his widely acclaimed work, "The Design of Everyday Things" (1988). This page will delve into Norman's design concepts, providing a shared and adaptable language for discussing design principles in both physical and virtual contexts.</p>

      <h2>Percieved Affordance</h2>
      <p>Although Norman did not coin the term or originate the idea of "affordance," he is acknowledged for introducing the concept of "perceived affordance," which pertains to how users interpret and perceive the function of a device. This distinction is subtle but crucial in effective design, where the affordance should not only align with the intended function but also be clearly visible to the user.</p>
      <p>In well-designed instances, especially for simple objects like a pencil, hammer, or scissors, we are often unaware of the cues a device provides, indicating sound design. If we find ourselves having to consciously think about how to operate a device, it typically means that its "perceived affordance" is not readily apparent to the user, or the device's affordance does not align with its function. This concept of affordance extends to electronic devices and computer interfaces, and throughout this chapter, we will explore how both physical objects and web pages can either accurately convey cues for operation or mislead the user.</p>
      <p>In later editions of "The Design of Everyday Things" (DOET), Norman discusses how readers have shared numerous examples of "Norman Doors" or "Norman devices." These refer to doors or devices whose affordances convey incorrect cues for operation. For instance, a door handle suggesting pulling when pushing is required, or a handle designed for pulling with a shape that signals pushing due to its wide, flat design. The images below illustrate examples of door handles with different affordances. Can you identify any instances of "Norman doors" where handles provide misleading information to the user?</p>

      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      <p>Constraints serve to restrict user actions, aiming to prevent errors and the misuse of a device. Unlike affordances, which guide users toward specific operations, constraints limit a system's choices to avoid errors, protect the device from damage, and prevent harm to the user or others. By establishing boundaries, constraints direct users toward the correct operation or usage of a system. Using examples from the automotive context, constraints include features such as the inability to remove a key from a car ignition until the engine is turned off, the incapability of shifting the transmission into reverse while the car is in forward motion, and the audible chime that sounds when attempting to exit the car with the key still in the ignition.</p>

      <h2>Visibility and Feedback</h2>
      <p>While Donald Norman did not coin the term "affordance" or originate its concept, he is recognized for introducing the idea of "perceived affordance." This refers to how users interpret and perceive the function of a device. The distinction is subtle but crucial – effective design ensures that the affordance not only aligns with the intended function but is also clearly visible to the user. In well-designed objects, especially for simple items like a pencil, a hammer, or scissors, we are often unaware of the cues these devices convey to us, indicating sound design. When we have to consciously think about operating a device, it typically suggests that its "perceived affordance" is not apparent to the user or that the device's affordance does not match its function. The concept of affordance extends to electronic devices and computer interfaces. Throughout this chapter, we will explore how both physical objects and web pages can either provide accurate cues for operation or mislead the user.</p>
