      <p>Universal Design is based on the belief that human abilities vary widely, and an individual's capabilities can fluctuate across time and situations. Embracing a Universal Design approach involves taking into account the diverse range of abilities among users to create a design that caters to the needs of a broad spectrum of individuals, encompassing those with disabilities.</p>

      <p>Universal Design emphasizes the integration of accessibility considerations and acknowledgment of users' diverse abilities from the initial stages of the design process, persisting throughout development until implementation. Accessibility is commonly achieved through either a distinct design or the utilization of separate Assistive Technology products (such as screen readers for auditory computer and internet access for individuals with blindness or low vision), services (like sign-language interpreters translating uncaptioned videos for deaf individuals), or adaptations to existing structures or products (such as the addition of wheelchair ramps to buildings). In contrast, Universal Design aspires to create a singular design or product that caters to the needs of all users. The benefits of attaining accessibility through Universal Design, as opposed to opting for a separate design or relying on Assistive Technology, are summarized in the table below.</p>

      <img src="images/shanghai.png" alt="Wheelchair Ramp In Shanghai China"  style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
      <p>The incline of the ramp above is evidently more steep than the recommended 1:12 slope, as specified by regulations like the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).</p>

      <p>In the photo above, ramps built into the design of a project tend to be aesthetic and allow a low grade incline as shown here.</p>
