      <p>Several experts emphasize that Universal Design should be approached as a design philosophy rather than a rigid checklist or a set of predefined solutions, measurements, or products. On this page, we aim to establish a step-by-step method for achieving Universal Design on the web. To initiate this process, we will explore fundamental design principles outlined by cognitive scientists and design authorities. One key influence in this domain is Donald Norman, whose significant impact on design practices is evident in his widely acclaimed work, "The Design of Everyday Things" (1988). This page will delve into Norman's design concepts, providing a shared and adaptable language for discussing design principles in both physical and virtual contexts.</p>

      <h2>Percieved Affordance</h2>
      <p>While Donald Norman did not coin the term "affordance" or originate its concept, he is recognized for introducing the idea of "perceived affordance." This refers to how users interpret and perceive the function of a device. The distinction is subtle but crucial – effective design ensures that the affordance not only aligns with the intended function but is also clearly visible to the user. In well-designed objects, especially for simple items like a pencil, a hammer, or scissors, we are often unaware of the cues these devices convey to us, indicating sound design. When we have to consciously think about operating a device, it typically suggests that its "perceived affordance" is not apparent to the user or that the device's affordance does not match its function. The concept of affordance extends to electronic devices and computer interfaces. Throughout this chapter, we will explore how both physical objects and web pages can either provide accurate cues for operation or mislead the user.</p>

      <h2>Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve</h2>
      <p>Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is in southern Colorado. It’s known for huge dunes like the towering Star Dune, and for the seasonal Medano Creek and beach created at the base of the dunes. The backcountry Medano Pass Primitive Road winds through a canyon toward the Sangre de Cristo mountains. Trails lead to forests, wetlands and alpine lakes like Medano Lake, which is home to trout and tundra wildlife.</p>

      <h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h2>
      <p>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is in western Colorado. It surrounds part of a deep, steep-walled gorge carved through Precambrian rock by the Gunnison River. Roads and trails along the north and south rims have views of the Black Canyon's dramatic drops and the striated Painted Wall cliff. The winding East Portal Road descends to the river. Wildlife includes mule deer, elk and golden eagles.</p>

      <h2>Lost Creek Wilderness</h2>
      <p>The Lost Creek Wilderness is a 119,790-acre wilderness area located in central Colorado in Jefferson and Park counties, south of the town of Bailey. The area is situated entirely within the boundaries of the Pike National Forest.</p>

      <h2>Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness (Colorado)</h2>
      <p>The Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness is located in western Colorado with a small portion extending into eastern Utah, USA, within the arid Colorado Plateau region approximately 15 miles west of Grand Junction, Colorado. The wilderness lies on the northwest flank of the Uncompahgre Plateau.</p>
