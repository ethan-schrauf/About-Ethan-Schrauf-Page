        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Ethan Schrauf, a junior enrolled in the computer science program at CU Boulder. Outside of my academic pursuits, I find joy in various activities. Skiing is a passion of mine, and I frequent the Epic resorts to indulge in this exhilarating sport. Capturing breathtaking aerial views is another interest of mine, as I take pleasure in flying my drone to explore and document scenic landscapes. </p>
        <p>Photography is more than just a hobby for me; it's a profound passion. I thoroughly enjoy expressing my creativity through the lens, capturing moments, sceneries, and emotions that provoke a sense of wonder. I've attached some of my photographic work below for you to see a glimpse of what I love to capture and create.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the images I've shared. They represent my perspective and enthusiasm for photography, an art form that allows me to encapsulate the beauty I encounter in the world around me.</p>
