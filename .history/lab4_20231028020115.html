    <h2>Colorado Wildlife</h2>
    <p>Colorado is home to several native wildlife species that make this state’s natural beauty what it is. It’s also home to plenty of lesser-known, but equally fascinating animals that live in Colorado. Knowing where and what to look for is important in spotting your favorite wildlife.

    <h2>➼ American Bison</h2>
    <p>The American Bison are large mammals that can reach up to 6.5 feet tall and weigh up to 2,200 pounds. They travel in herds and have an average life span of 20 years. When needed, a bison can run at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour. At one point in time, there were 60 million bison that roamed the plains of North America, but due to overhunting, the bison nearly became extinct.</p>

    <p>According to the Colorado Encyclopedia, The Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep is one of four native sheep species that live in North America, with the only one residing in Colorado. A sight for sore eyes, the bighorn sheep are larger animals weighing anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds. The distinctive males, or rather the rams, have large curled horns that are used for defense and foraging.</p>
