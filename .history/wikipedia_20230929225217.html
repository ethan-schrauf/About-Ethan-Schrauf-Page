    <p>Chamberlain became dissatisfied with high school during the end of her sophomore year, and after speaking to her father she was encouraged to find a passion outside of school, on June 14, 2016, she launched her YouTube channel as a way to find that passion and in August 2023, her YouTube channel reached 12 million subscribers and gained a total of 1.61 billion video views.[12][13] Chamberlain's content included cooking videos, fashion hauls, and car vlogs, among others.

    <p>In June 2018, Tana Mongeau invited Chamberlain to be a Featured Creator at Tanacon in Anaheim, Mongeau's alternative to VidCon that took place at the same time at a nearby convention center. Chamberlain's one-on-one onstage interview with Mongeau was the last event before the convention was canceled due to overcrowding and security concerns.[20] In July, Chamberlain was signed by United Talent Agency.[21]</p>
    <p>At VidCon 2019, Snapchat announced that Chamberlain would be one of several celebrities from various entertainment platforms to premiere a Creator Show later in the year.[22] At the 2019 Teen Choice Awards, Chamberlain won the award for Choice Female Web Star.[23] During the September New York Fashion Week, Chamberlain hosted the Teen Vogue event Generation Next attended by Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour.[24] At the 45th People's Choice Awards, she was nominated for the Social Star award.[25] She collaborated with eyewear company Crap Eyewear for a line of sunglasses she helped design.[26]</p>
    <p>She attended her second Louis Vuitton-sponsored Paris Fashion Week, collaborating with Vogue for a preparation video about the process.[27] She collaborated with Calvin Klein for a series of videos and photo shoots.[28] At the 2019 Streamy Awards, Chamberlain was nominated for Creator of the Year, Editing, and First Person.[29] She appeared in a series of videos on the Target YouTube channel, being paired with The Office star Angela Kinsey and Fashion Police host Brad Goreski.[30] Her Snapchat Creator Show, Adulting With Emma Chamberlain, premiered on November 4.[31] On November 13, Time magazine included her on its Time 100 Next list,[3] and its list of the 25 most influential people on the internet, writing that "Chamberlain pioneered an approach to vlogging that shook up YouTube's unofficial style guide."[32][failed verification] In December 2019, she was featured in a segment broadcast on ABC News Nightline, being interviewed about her career by Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon.[33]</p>
