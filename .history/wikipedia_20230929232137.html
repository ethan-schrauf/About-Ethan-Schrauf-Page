    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Chamberlain was born on May 22, 2001, in San Bruno, California, to artist Michael John Chamberlain and flight coordinator Sophia Pinetree Chamberlain. She is the only child of her parents, who divorced when she was five years old.[1]</p>
    <p>In a 2018 interview with Forbes, Chamberlain said her family had struggled with finances during her childhood. The family had depended on commissions for her father's art, and when he was ill and unable to paint they endured "hard times".[8]</p>
    <p>She attended Central Middle School in San Carlos, California, and Notre Dame High School, Belmont,[9] an all-girl Catholic preparatory school where she was on the cheerleading and track teams. She performed competitive cheer for five years and was a member of the California All Stars Pink cheer team.[10] She left high school during the first semester of her junior year and graduated after passing the California High School Exit Exam.[11]</p>

    <h3>YouTube</h3>

    <p>Chamberlain became dissatisfied with high school during the end of her sophomore year, and after speaking to her father she was encouraged to find a passion outside of school, on June 14, 2016, she launched her YouTube channel as a way to find that passion and in August 2023, her YouTube channel reached 12 million subscribers and gained a total of 1.61 billion video views.[12][13] Chamberlain's content included cooking videos, fashion hauls, and car vlogs, among others. She was known for her penchant with coffee, as well as her authentic self-deprecating humor.[14] Chamberlain gained notoriety for her niche editing style defined by zooms, adding text to the screen, and pauses.[1] Her style of editing has gone on to be replicated by many other YouTubers, including Antonio Garza and James Charles. In recent years, Chamberlain has shifted away from that video style to a simpler, more documentary style of editing.[15]</p>
    <p>In June 2018, Chamberlain moved alone from the Bay Area to Los Angeles.[1] There, she formed the Sister Squad with fellow teen YouTubers James Charles and comedy duo The Dolan Twins.[16] The four were featured in YouTube Rewind 2018.[17] The Sister Squad was nominated for a 2019 YouTube Ensemble Shorty Award.[18]</p>

    <p>In June 2018, Tana Mongeau invited Chamberlain to be a Featured Creator at Tanacon in Anaheim, Mongeau's alternative to VidCon that took place at the same time at a nearby convention center. Chamberlain's one-on-one onstage interview with Mongeau was the last event before the convention was canceled due to overcrowding and security concerns.[20] In July, Chamberlain was signed by United Talent Agency.[21]</p>
    <p>At VidCon 2019, Snapchat announced that Chamberlain would be one of several celebrities from various entertainment platforms to premiere a Creator Show later in the year.[22] At the 2019 Teen Choice Awards, Chamberlain won the award for Choice Female Web Star.[23] During the September New York Fashion Week, Chamberlain hosted the Teen Vogue event Generation Next attended by Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour.[24] At the 45th People's Choice Awards, she was nominated for the Social Star award.[25] She collaborated with eyewear company Crap Eyewear for a line of sunglasses she helped design.[26]</p>
